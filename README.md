# Cube-Escape-Remake-
One of the first my project

___Welcome to Cube Escape V1.0 (by Alex Zbar..)___


This is a reworked and adapted to a newer unity version of my project from +-2019.

This is just one simple example of what i can do.

Most likely I won't update this project since I created it just for example.


_____How to install____

1. To open the project, make sure you have Unity installed and preferably the version is +- 2022.3.5f1
2. Then move the entire folder, for example, to the desktop
3. Then go to the unity hub, click ("Add") and select the desired folder
4. Wenn it will open, find from above " ► " and press press it
5. Enjoy! o(≧▽≦)o
